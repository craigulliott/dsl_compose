  class DSL

    # a new dynamic DSL. This class is instantaited by the DSLCompose::DSL class and our internal
    # DSL is evaluated by passing a block to `instance_eval` on this class.
    #
    # An example of our internal DSL:
    #  define_dsl :my_dsl do
    #    description "This is my DSL"
    #    add_method :my_method do
    #      # ...
